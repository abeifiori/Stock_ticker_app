# Data Incubator Milestone Project: Flask Stock Ticker App on Heroku

This project contains the files for the stock ticker project which
deployed on Heroku at
https://beifiori-dataincubator-project.herokuapp.com

The app queries the Quandl WIKI datasets API to generate an interactive plot of stock data from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange dataset.
The user can plot different stock tickers by choosing a ticker symbol (see https://www.quandl.com/data/FSE-Frankfurt-Stock-Exchange?keyword= for a reference), or select a range of dates, as well as the type of data to plot.

## Getting Started
Download the files, and run the app as python app.py
Open http://localhost:5000 with your web browser.
You should see your app running locally.
Or run the app from Heroku.
